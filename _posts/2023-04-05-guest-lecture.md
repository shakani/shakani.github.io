I was recently invited to give a guest lecture at Georgia Tech for a graduate level quantum mechanics course. I chose to give a short talk on using perturbation theory to derive an effective Hamiltonian. This is the usual second order perturbation theory derivation of obtaining the Heisenberg Hamiltonian from the Hubbard Hamiltonian. My [notes](https://shakani.github.io/files/PHYS_6106_Superexchange_Lecture_Notes.pdf) on this topic are available for anyone interested.
