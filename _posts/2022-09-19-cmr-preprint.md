New preprint on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08672) entitled "Control of chiral orbital currents in a colossal magnetoresistance material." The finalized version will be published in Nature later this year! Huge congratulations to my collaborators at University of Colorado at Boulder, Oak Ridge National Lab, and University of Kentucky.
